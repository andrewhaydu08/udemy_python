#Booleans Practice #1

#Make a comparison that returns a boolean and store the result (True/False) in a variable called test
test = 7==6+1
print(test)

#Check if 17834/34 is greater than 87*56 and print the boolean result to the screen using print()
result = 17834/34 > 87*56
print(result)


#Check if the square root of 25 is equal to 5 and display the result (boolean) on the screen using print()
print(25**0.5==5)
